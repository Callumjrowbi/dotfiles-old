<h1>My laptop's Dotfiles</h1>
<p>Hey - these are my dotfiles which i use for my laptop, the master branch contains the dotfiles for my Desktop </p>
<ul>Most of my dotfiles are based off of Lucy's dotfiles which can be found <b><a href="https://github.com/lucyy-mc/dotfiles/tree/main">here</a></b>.</ul>
<ul>My laptop dotfiles are used on an old laptop which I brought back to life, you can see the specs <b><a href="https://callumjt.me/laptop-neofetch">here</a></b>.</ul>
<ul>It will not work 100% flawlessly on every system, you may need to adjust them too your liking</ul>
<h1>I'm not very good at this; be nice please :D</h1>
